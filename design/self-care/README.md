### Description
For users of mobile operator services, it was necessary to develop an application for self-care that would make it easier for users to keep records of subscriptions and internet usage, calls and messages. As with the [chat application](../chat/README.md), I led the development of the UX/UI design from the initial research stage to developer support.
