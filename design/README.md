# Design

Everything generally starts from here, so it is important to do it in as much detail as possible.

The design approach is done in several stages.

- Research - Product Understanding and Competition Analysis.
- Style Guide & Moodboard
- Sitemap & Wireframes
- Page Design

#### Research - Product Understanding and Competition Analysis
The research phase is a fundamental step in the project development process. This stage is crucial because it allows a deep understanding of the product, the market and the competition to be gained. Through thorough research, teams will gain insight into current trends, customer needs and competitive advantages, which in turn will lay the foundation for successful product development.

#### Style Guide & Moodboard
Creation of a moodboard to test out the visual direction and decide on the final approach.

Once the final concept is approved, a style guide will be created to ensure everything on the website is consistent with the direction. The style guide is being created in parallel with the home page. It is a living thing, meaning it evolves with the designs. Once the homepage is completed and approved, the style guide can be signed off.

#### Sitemap & Wireframes
Defining the pages that will exist on the website and the sections they will contain. Creating a website blueprint, which will be used while designing the actual pages.

The wireframes will serve as skeletons to help us define what information we should communicate through which page and section.

#### Page Design
Application of the defined style and moodboard concepts. This includes the layout of the pages and their sections defined in the wireframing phase, typography, placement of imagery and iconography, etc.
